# Agent Development Logs

This directory contains logs and status files from AI-assisted development sessions.

These files document the development process, feature completions, and project milestones. They are kept for historical reference and transparency about how the project was built.

## File Organization

- `*_COMPLETE.md` - Feature completion markers
- `*_STATUS.md` - Status snapshots during development
- `*_SUMMARY.md` - Development session summaries
- `*_SETUP.md` - Setup and configuration logs
- Technical documents (e.g., `GENSERVER_*.md`, `OMNETPP_*.md`, `CAF_*.md`)

These files are not required for using the library but may be useful for:
- Understanding the development history
- Learning about the decision-making process
- Seeing how features evolved over time
- Contributing similar features

For current documentation, see the main `/docs` directory.
