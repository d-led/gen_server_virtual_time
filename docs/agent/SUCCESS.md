## 🚀 Key Features

### Virtual Time Testing

```elixir
# Before: Wait 10 seconds ❌
Process.sleep(10_000)

# After: Instant! ✅
VirtualClock.advance(clock, 10_000)
```

**Result**: 100x faster, zero flakiness

### Actor Simulation

```elixir
ActorSimulation.new()
|> add_actor(:producer, send_pattern: {:rate, 100, :msg})
|> run(duration: 60_000)
```

**Result**: Simulate 1 minute instantly

### Condition-Based Termination

```elixir
|> run(
    max_duration: 30_000,
    terminate_when: fn sim -> goals_achieved?(sim) end
  )
```

**Result**: Stop early, save time

### Enhanced Diagrams

```elixir
mermaid = trace_to_mermaid(sim, enhanced: true, timestamps: true)
```

**Result**: Beautiful visualizations with activation boxes and timestamps

### Dining Philosophers

```elixir
DiningPhilosophers.create_simulation(num_philosophers: 5)
|> run(terminate_when: fn sim -> all_fed?(sim) end)
```

**Result**: Classic problem solved, visualized, condition-terminated

## 🎬 Final Demo Output

### Condition-Based Termination

```
✅ Terminated early when goal achieved!
⏱️  Virtual time: 1000ms (vs 10,000ms max)
💡 Saved: 9000ms of unnecessary simulation
```

### Dining Philosophers

```
🍴 Goal: Ensure all 5 philosophers eat at least 5 times
✅ All philosophers fed!
⏱️  Virtual time: 1000ms (vs 30,000ms max)
   philosopher_0: ~5 meals
   ...
💡 Simulation stopped as soon as goal was met!
```

### Enhanced Diagrams

```
sequenceDiagram
    activate server
    client->>server: :request
    deactivate server
    client-->>observer: :notify
    Note over client,server: t=100ms
```
