# Documentation Cleanup Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-12  
**Task**: Clean up README and verify agent summaries

---

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

### 1. README Badges Updated

Added proper GitHub status badges to `/README.md`:

```markdown
[![Hex.pm](https://img.shields.io/hexpm/v/gen_server_virtual_time.svg)](https://hex.pm/packages/gen_server_virtual_time)
[![Documentation](https://img.shields.io/badge/docs-hexdocs-blue.svg)](https://hexdocs.pm/gen_server_virtual_time)
[![CI](https://github.com/d-led/gen_server_virtual_time/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/d-led/gen_server_virtual_time/actions)
[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/d-led/gen_server_virtual_time/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://coveralls.io/github/d-led/gen_server_virtual_time?branch=main)
```

**Badges Now Include**:

- ‚úÖ Hex.pm version (existing)
- ‚úÖ HexDocs link (existing)
- ‚úÖ GitHub Actions CI status (NEW)
- ‚úÖ Coveralls code coverage (NEW)

### 2. CI Coverage Job Added

Added coverage reporting to `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:

```yaml
coverage:
  name: Code Coverage
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest

  steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v4

    - name: Setup Elixir
      uses: erlef/setup-beam@v1
      with:
        elixir-version: "1.16"
        otp-version: "26"

    - name: Run tests with coverage
      env:
        MIX_ENV: test
        GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      run: mix coveralls.github --exclude slow --exclude omnetpp
```

This will automatically report coverage to Coveralls.io on every CI run.

### 3. Agent Summaries Verified

Created `/docs/agent/VERIFICATION_RESULTS.md` documenting:

- ‚úÖ What's accurate in agent summaries
- ‚ùå What's outdated (test counts)
- üìã Recommendations for updates

**Key Findings**:

- Actual test count: **189 tests, 0 failures** (not 80, not 131)
- 23 test files
- All claimed features exist and work
- CHANGELOG.md is accurate and current

### 4. Agent Summaries Updated

Added historical disclaimer headers to outdated agent summaries:

**Files Updated**:

1. `/docs/agent/README.md` - Added warning about historical artifacts
2. `/docs/agent/COMPLETE_FEATURE_LIST.md` - Updated test count from 80 to 189
3. `/docs/agent/READY_TO_SHIP.md` - Updated test count from 131 to 189
4. `/docs/agent/FEATURE_SUMMARY.md` - Updated test count from 37 to 189

**Example Header Added**:

```markdown
‚ö†Ô∏è **HISTORICAL SNAPSHOT** - This document is from a development session and
contains **OUTDATED TEST COUNTS**. See `/CHANGELOG.md` for current information
or run `mix test` to see actual test count (189 tests as of v0.2.0).
```

### 5. README Verified Clean

‚úÖ No "pro tips" or debugging pipeline advice in main README  
‚úÖ Focused on library features and generators  
‚úÖ All examples are tested and work  
‚úÖ Links to detailed docs in separate files

---

## üìä Current Project Status

### Version

- **Version**: 0.2.0 (per `mix.exs`)
- **Release Date**: 2025-10-12 (per `CHANGELOG.md`)

### Tests

- **Test Files**: 23 files
- **Test Count**: 189 tests, 0 failures, 17 excluded
- **Test Coverage**: Will be reported to Coveralls after next CI run

### Generators

All 6 generators exist and work:

1. ‚úÖ OMNeT++ Generator (C++ network simulation)
2. ‚úÖ CAF Generator (C++ Actor Framework)
3. ‚úÖ Pony Generator (Capabilities-secure actors)
4. ‚úÖ Phony Generator (Go actors)
5. ‚úÖ VLINGO Generator (Java actors)
6. ‚úÖ Mermaid Report Generator (Flowchart reports)

All generators support callback-based extensibility.

### Documentation

- ‚úÖ `/README.md` - Clean, focused, with proper badges
- ‚úÖ `/CHANGELOG.md` - Accurate and up-to-date
- ‚úÖ `/docs/*.md` - Generator documentation is accurate
- ‚úÖ `/docs/agent/*.md` - Historical artifacts labeled as such

## üéØ Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. ‚úÖ **DONE**: Update README badges
2. ‚úÖ **DONE**: Add CI coverage job
3. ‚úÖ **DONE**: Verify agent summaries
4. ‚úÖ **DONE**: Add disclaimers to outdated docs

### Future Considerations

1. **Consider moving** `docs/agent/` to `docs/development/history/` for clarity
2. **Keep** CHANGELOG.md as single source of truth
3. **Archive** very old agent summaries if they cause confusion
4. **Run** `mix coveralls.html` locally to verify coverage before first CI run

## Next Steps (If Needed)

If publishing to Hex.pm or making a release:

1. Verify Coveralls badge shows up after first CI run with coverage
2. Tag release: `git tag v0.2.0 && git push origin v0.2.0`
3. Publish to Hex: `mix hex.publish`
4. Update GitHub release notes from CHANGELOG
